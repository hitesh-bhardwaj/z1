              Over the past few years, the term Experience Design and User
              Experience have become so closely associated that they're often
              used interchangeably. They're interconnected, but they're not
              identical. And that disparity means there are vital differences
              between them.
              <br />
              <br />
              <strong> Donald Arthur Norman</strong> coined the term ‘User
              Experience Design’ while employed at Apple as a User Interface
              Architect. Sometime during the early 1990s, he decided to change
              his title to User Experience Architect. Why did he do it? In Don’s
              own words -
            </p>
            
            <blockquote className="bold strong" id="anim">
              “I invented the term because I thought Human Interface and
              usability were too narrow: I wanted to cover all aspects of the
              person’s experience with a system, including industrial design,
              graphics, the interface, the physical interaction, and the
              manual.”

              The term User Experience Design was not coined until the early ,
              but examples of Experience Design date back even earlier. For
              instance, Walt Disney is often regarded as one of the worlds first
              Experience Designer because of his theme parks and resorts.

              Walt Disney had the vision to create an amusement park that was
              fun for both children and adults alike. However, during thes,
              amusement parks were seen as dirty and dowdy places where children
              shouldnt go. Walt Disney wanted to change that perception and
              provide park-goers with a positive experience. The designers and
              engineers put a lot of thought and contemplation into the park
              (Disney Imagineers).

            <p>
              An example of good experience design at the parks is the variety
              of choices that visitors can select from. The parks were designed
              to appeal to all kinds of guests. Whether youre a teenager looking
              for thrill-seeking rides or a young family wanting to ride Dumbo
              the flying elephant or the teacup ride, theres something for
              everyone here.
